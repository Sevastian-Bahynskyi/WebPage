            <p>
                We are a bunch of students with a great passion about board games. These days, everybody is connected
                through the internet,
                new platforms of communication are launched every day, each one with one specific purpose: connect
                people who read manga, connect
                horse lover...<br> <br>
                We've seen very different topics in millions of platforms around the globe, allowing global connections,
                but also a better organisation among local communities. <br> <br>
