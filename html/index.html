            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>
                We are a bunch of students with a great passion about board games. These days, everybody is connected
                through the internet,
                new platforms of communication are launched every day, each one with one specific purpose: connect
                people who read manga, connect
                horse lover...<br> <br>
                We've seen very different topics in millions of platforms around the globe, allowing global connections,
                but also a better organisation among local communities. <br> <br>
                No need to go any further, here in Horsens, different Facebook groups have been stablished for things
                such as selling second hand bicycles or sharing useful infromation
                with new international students that arrive every year. <br> <br> However, despite this great
                organisation in the internet, we found a whole that no platform was able to cover. What about meeting
                and playing some videogames with friends? <br><br> We haven't seen something similar to that increasing
                demand.
                <br>We present you our solutionðŸ™ƒ <br>
                I hope you enjoy the priceless time with your friends.
