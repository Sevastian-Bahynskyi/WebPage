                    <h1>Children's games</h1>
                    <p>It makes sense that the popularity of board games for kids went through the roof during
                        quarantine
                        and in the early days of the pandemic — families were looking for a way to pass the time
                        while
                        they
                        were
                        stuck at home. However this type of board game not only for children. If you don't have much
                        time or
                        you
                        don't want to learn difficult rules - children's game is for you.</p>

                    <p>If you're looking for tips on being the life of the party, look no further. Picture this
                        scene.
                        Everyone is happily chatting, looking relaxed, maybe some are inebriated. “Who wants to play
                        a
                        game!?” you inquire. It appears no one wants to speak over one another, so they all remain
                        silent.
                        Than you say with trembling voice: "I brought party games. Everyone can play!.” The crowd
                        goes
                        wild
                        as partygoers rush to the table, eager to grab a spot. You are loved.</p>

                    <h1>Deduction games</h1>
                    <p>Deduction games are those that require players to form conclusions based on available
                        premises.
                        Cat &
                        Mouse games like Scotland Yard are a type of Deduction game in which players use a set of
                        observations and truthful feedback to narrow down possibilities and catch a constantly
                        moving
                        opponent at the right position. Elimination games like Clue expect players to arrive at the
                        right
                        conclusion after narrowing down possibilities from a large list.</p>

                    <h1>Family games</h1>
                    <p>Board games can teach cooperation, communication and problem-solving skills. And they're a
                        great
                        way
                        to spend time with friends and family. Board games for families have come a long, long way
                        since
                        Monopoly. Sure, it may still be the first one that comes to mind, but there's no shortage of
                        choice
                        these days. You'll be grateful to have a game on hand that doesn't require technology — one
                        that
                        everyone in your fam can agree on.</p>
